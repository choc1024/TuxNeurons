# ⚠️ WARNING: This Repository Is Unmaintained! ⚠️
TuxNeurons is now deprecated and I moved to another AI project called Instant AI Cooker, which is lightweight, small, and easy to use. This repository will not be maintained anymore. You are free to fork it and continue it, however.

# TuxNeurons
![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/WARNING-Danger-red)

CHANGELOG: [View Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

An experimental, low level alternative to tensorflow. Note: Even though the image features Tux, the linux mascot, the library itself works cross-platform, as long as Python is available.

# What
TuxNeurons is a lightweight python library designed to make neuron networks EASY!

# Why
I made this so I can learn about neural networks and I published this so everyone else can learn about them too!

# Usage
Just download tuxneurons.py into your project folder and in the same directory do `import tuxneurons` or `from tuxneurons import *`. More usage available in the Wiki, where I try my best to explain everything clearly to everyone, even to those new to neural networks.

# Contributing
Please Star this project! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, etc please open an Issue, Pull Request or Discussion!

If you want to donate, contact me (anonymous7546@duck.com), as... well, this entire project is being developed and maintained only by me and aparently no one is coming to help.

# Note on performance
TuxNeurons is focused on making neural network creation and training more intuitive and easy to understand rather than performance. Each neuron is a class, and training has not been fully implemented (WIP) yet, so not for commertial nor production use, although you can.
