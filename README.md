# TuxNeurons
An experimental, low level alternative to tensorflow. Note: Even though the image features Tux, the linux mascot, the library itself works cross-platform, as long as Python is available.

# What
TuxNeurons is a lightweight python library designed to make neuron networks EASY!

# Why
I made this so I can learn about neural networks and I published this so everyone else can learn about them too!

# Usage
Just download tuxneurons.py into your project folder and in the same directory do `import tuxneurons` or `from tuxneurons import *`. More usage available in the Wiki, where I try my best to explain everything clearly to everyone, even to those new to neural networks.
